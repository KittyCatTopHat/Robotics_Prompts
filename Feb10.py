I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happend to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!""")

print("That is done now... moving on.")
print("""I just read it, and of course I have an excuse to not do this in the middle of feild! What if I don't have my phone, or there's no service, or I just want enjoy the fact I'm in a feild and not rotting away infront of a screen?!?""")
